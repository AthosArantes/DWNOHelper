Use at own risk.

## Features:
- Make digimons tell their remaining life span (press F1);
- Allow unrestricted ExE;

## How to use:
After compiling the helper, you'll need a dll injector (any basic injector will be enough, here is a simple open source:
[DLL-Injector](https://github.com/adamhlt/DLL-Injector)).\
Then you will be able to inject the .dll when the game is running.
